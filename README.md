# Usage
install with `npm install minstall --save` and add minstall as postinstall-script, by adding it to your package.json like this:
```JavaScript
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "minstall <modules-folder>"
  }
}
```
`modules-folder` is optional and will default to `modules` if omitted

# What does it do?
It installs dependencies of all modules (and possibly these of submodules of submodules etc.) into the root-`node_modules`.
It also symlinks all the modules to the root-`node_modules`
When it encounters a dependency, that has already been installed in an incompatible version, it'll install those incompatible depencenies in their own node_modules-folder within the module that has these dependencies

# Why does it do this (what is the benefit)?
- It allows the automatic installation of sub-modules that are in a `modules`-folder on `npm install`.
- It minimizes the installed dependencies, because all dependencies are installed in the root-`node_modules`
- Because all sub-modules are linked into the root-`node_modules`, they can be required without navigating. Instead of `require('./modules/myModule')` you can just say `require('myModule')`

# How does it do this?
1. Look for a `modules`-folder, and for modules in it
1. Gather the module details from the package.json of every module.
1. Remove all module-symlinks from the root-`node_modules`
1. npm-install all dependencies of all modules into the root-`node_modules`
1. Run the postinstall-commands of the modules by doing the following for every module:
    1. check, if a postinstall command exists. if not, continue with the next module
    1. create a symlink in the module-folder that points to the root-`node_modules`
    1. run the postinstall-command
    1. remove the previously created symlink.
1. create symlinks in the root-`node_modules` that point to the module-folders

# Why are certain things done the way they are?
- step 2: this is done, so that the following npm-install wouldn't try to recursively install things within `node_modules`
- step 5.2: this is done, so that possible npm-installs done by the postinstall end up in the root-`node_modules`, and any possible dependencies needed by the postinstall are avaliable to it
- step 6: this is done, so that the modules can be required without navigating to it in the require-statement

# Glossary
##### root-node_modules
